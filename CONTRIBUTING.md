# Licensing

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in Liwan by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be licensed under the terms of both the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0) and the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit) without any additional terms or conditions. This dual licensing is intended to allow possible future re-licensing under a more permissive license and monitization of the project. If you do not agree with this dual licensing, you should not contribute to the project (which is fine! you can still use and modify it under the terms of the AGPLv3).

Please add your name to the list of contributors at the end of this file if you make a significant contribution to the project to confirm that you agree to the dual licensing. This is a requirement for your contribution to be accepted.
